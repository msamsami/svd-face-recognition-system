Face Recognition System using the SVD

The object of this project is to build a face recognition system using the SVD decomposition. A face recognition system tries to recognize a person's face among a number of faces it has previously seen. A simple face recognition system can be built by taking a number of pictures of a person's face and storing them in memory. Every time an individual appears before the system, a picture is taken and compared to the set of faces in memory. The closest match to the individuals face is found and the individuals identity is declared. A good system should be able to recognize a person's face under different lighting conditions and be robust to changes in the person's pose and appearance. A good system should also require minimum computation and memory so that it can be expanded to recognize millions of faces.

This was a MATLAB project for Linear Algebra course at Shiraz University which was lectured by Dr. Hamed Masnadi-Shirazi back in Spring 2016 semester. The project guide is also included.
